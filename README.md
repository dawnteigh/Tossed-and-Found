# Tossed and Found

If you're a disc golfer, chances are you've spent a fair amount of time searching for a disc after the occasional wayward throw. Sometimes, you don't find it. Maybe your disc ended up in a pond, or it's gotten too dark to see, or perhaps you just plain overlooked it. Some disc golfers will write their phone number on the back of their discs in the hopes that someone will find and kindly reach out to return them if they get lost. But what if you aren't comfortable with putting your personal information out there for just anyone to happen across? Tossed and Found is a disc golf companion app that aims to provide a solution to that issue. When you add your discs to your Tossed and Found account, they are assigned a unique finder key that you can then write on the back of your disc instead of your phone number. If another user finds your disc, they can look it up by entering this key in the search, and reach out via instant message so you can arrange a time and place (preferably public!) to retrieve your disc. Tossed and Found also functions as a scorekeeper, and has a publicly sourced course catalog that displays the top 3 scores for each.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Roadmap
Obviously, a whole lot of work is left to be done if this is ever going to be a legitimate app. Those goals will be outlined here.
Future additions/changes:
- Implement a system that encourages and rewards returning lost discs. Users with a certain community standing may receive invites to exclusive tournaments and events, or special offers from sponsors.

- Fleshed out user profiles.

- Allow for further disc editing (at least allow users to update the img).

- Vastly improved Courses section, with maps, location services, a search feature, and a filter to show the courses nearest to the user first. New course submissions will have to be approved before they are added.

- Better looking UI and logo

- Better messaging, where users can delete messages
